# ICC Cricket World Cup Winner Prediction

**Description**

* We have taken the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 Players Data Dataset which is available in Kaggle.This was used for visualizations
https://www.kaggle.com/saivamshi/cricket-world-cup-2019-players-data
* Then for Model Building Purposes we took extra datasets from Cricbuzz Website
* Here's the drive link for the entire dataset for our project:

The Jupyter Notebook code for Preprocessing and Prediction Model is given in ICC 2019 WC RF.ipynb. 
We used Machine Learning to make a model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to predict the results of ICC 2019 Cricket World Cup.

**Model Implemention**

**Random Forest Classifier.**</br>
The main goal of our Project was to Predict the winner of ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 using Random Forest Classifier.RFs train each tree independently, using a random sample of the data. This randomness helps to make the model more robust than a single decision tree, and less likely to overfit on the training data.
We had the rankings of the teams participating in the tournament and gave higher priority to higher ranked teams to win.
